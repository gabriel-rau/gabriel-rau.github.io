  abstract        = {The long-term monitoring records of hydraulic heads frequently contain fluctuations originating from different cyclic drivers. Fourier analysis applied to these records can reveal connected surface-water/groundwater system characteristics. The various components of the atmospheric tides, the earth tides and the presence of diurnal responses to evapotranspiration are identified and isolated through band-pass filtering of data recorded from both vented and absolute gauge transducers. The signature of the different cyclic drivers is contained in amplitude and phase of the various signal components and can be used to determine the degree of system confinement. A methodology is described for the calculation of barometric efficiency in confined aquifers based upon the amplitude of the M 2 and S 2 components of the earth and atmospheric tides. It is demonstrated that Fourier analysis of water-level fluctuations is a simple but underused tool that can help to characterise shallow groundwater systems.},

  abstract        = {Quantifying dryland groundwater recharge as a function of climate variability is becoming increasingly important in the face of a globally depleted resource, yet this remains a major challenge due to lack of adequate monitoring and the complexity of processes involved. A previously unpublished and unique dataset of high density and frequency rainfall measurements is presented, from the Fowlers Gap Arid Zone Research Station in western New South Wales (Australia). The dataset confirms extreme spatial and temporal variability in rainfall distribution which has been observed in other dryland areas and is generally explained by the dominance of individual storm cells. Contrary to previous observations, however, this dataset contains only a few localised storm cells despite the variability. The implications of spatiotemporal rainfall variability on the estimation of groundwater recharge is assessed and show that the most likely recharge mechanism is through indirect and localised, rather than direct, recharge. Examples of rainfall and stream gauge height illustrate runoff generation when a spatially averaged threshold of 15?25 mm (depending on the antecedent moisture conditions) is exceeded. Preliminary assessment of groundwater levels illustrates that the regional water table is much deeper than anticipated, especially considering the expected magnitude of indirect and localised recharge. A possible explanation is that pathways for indirect and localised recharge are inhibited by the large quantities of Aeolian dust observed at the site. Runoff readily occurs with water collecting in surface lakes which slowly dry and disappear. Assuming direct groundwater recharge under these conditions will significantly overestimate actual recharge.},

  abstract        = {We present results of a detailed study of drip rate variations at 12 drip discharge sites in Glory Hole Cave, New South Wales, Australia. Our novel time series analysis, using the wavelet synchrosqueezed transform, reveals pronounced oscillations at daily and sub-daily frequencies occurring in 8 out of the 12 monitored sites. These oscillations were not spatially or temporally homogenous, with different drip sites exhibiting such behaviour at different times of year in different parts of the cave. We test several hypotheses for the cause of the oscillations, including variations in pressure gradients between karst and cave due to cave breathing effects or atmospheric and earth tides, variations in hydraulic conductivity due to changes in viscosity of water with daily temperature oscillations, and solar-driven daily cycles of vegetative (phreatophytic) transpiration. We conclude that the only hypothesis consistent with the data and hydrologic theory is that daily oscillations are caused by solar-driven pumping by phreatophytic trees which are abundant at the site. The daily oscillations are not continuous and occur sporadically in short bursts (2{\&}ndash;14 days) throughout the year due to non-linear modification of the solar signal via complex karst architecture. This is the first indirect observation leading to the hypothesis of tree water use in cave drip water. It has important implications for karst hydrology in regards to developing a new protocol to determine the relative importance of trends in drip rate, such as diurnal oscillations, and how these trends change over timescales of weeks to years. This information can also be used to infer karst architecture. This study demonstrates the importance of vegetation on recharge dynamics, information that will inform both process-based karst models and empirical estimation approaches. Our findings support a growing body of research exploring the impact of trees on speleothem paleoclimate proxies.},

Two contrasting sites, one with fast transient and one with slow constant dripping, in a temperate semi-arid location (Wellington, NSW, Australia), exhibit drip water temperatures which deviate significantly from the cave air temperature. We confirm the hypothesis that evaporative cooling is the dominant, but so far unattributed, control causing significant disequilibrium between drip water and host rock/air temperatures. The amount of cooling is dependent on the drip rate, relative humidity and ventilation. Our results have implications for the interpretation of temperature-sensitive, speleothem climate proxies such as $\delta$(18)O, cave microecology and the use of heat as a tracer in karst. Understanding the processes controlling the temperature of speleothem-forming cave drip waters is vital for assessing the reliability of such deposits as archives of climate change.},

  abstract        = {Understanding and managing groundwater resources in drylands is a challenging task, but one that is globally important. The dominant process for dryland groundwater recharge is thought to be as focused, indirect recharge from ephemeral stream losses. However, there is a global paucity of data for understanding and quantifying this process and transferable techniques for quantifying groundwater recharge in such contexts are lacking. Here we develop a generalised conceptual model for understanding water table and groundwater head fluctuations due to recharge from episodic events within ephemeral streams. By accounting for the recession characteristics of a groundwater hydrograph, we present a simple but powerful new water table fluctuation approach to quantifying focused, indirect recharge over both long term and event timescales. The technique is demonstrated using a new, and globally unparalleled, set of groundwater observations from an ephemeral stream catchment located in NSW, Australia. We find that, following episodic streamflow events down a predominantly dry channel system, groundwater head fluctuations are controlled by pressure redistribution operating at three timescales from vertical flow (days to weeks), transverse flow perpendicular to the stream (weeks to months) and longitudinal flow parallel to the stream (years to decades). In relative terms, indirect recharge decreases almost linearly away from the mountain front, both in discrete monitored events as well as in the long term average. In absolute terms, the estimated indirect recharge varies from 80 to 30 mm/a with the main uncertainty in these values stemming from uncertainty in the catchment scale hydraulic properties.},

This method allows for a thorough treatment of the spatial information embedded in temperature data by creating a matrix visualization of all possible sensor pairs. Application of the method to a 5-day field dataset reveals the complexity of shallow streambed thermal regimes. To understand how velocity estimates are affected by violations of assumptions of one-dimensional, saturated, homogeneous flow and to aid in the interpretation of field observations, the method was also applied to temperature data generated by numerical models of common field conditions: horizontal layering, presence of lateral flow and variable streambed saturation. The results show that each condition creates a distinct signature visible in the triangular matrices. The matrices are used to perform a comparison of the behaviour of one-dimensional analytical heat-tracing models. The results show that the amplitude ratio-based method of velocity calculation leads to the most reliable estimates. The minimum sensor spacing required to obtain reliable velocity estimates with discrete sensors is also investigated using field data. The developed method will aid future heat-tracing studies by providing a technique for visualizing and comparing results from fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing installations and testing the robustness of analytical heat-tracing models.},

Soil moisture is highly variable both spatially and temporally. The development of methods to measure it on various scales has been the subject of much activity. Recently, geoscientists have been increasingly interested in measuring temperature as a proxy for hydrologic properties and parameters, including soil moisture. Here, we discuss the motivation, primary concepts, equipment, and fundamental thermal and hydraulic models related to heat and water transport in variably saturated porous media. A large variety of methods for heat tracing, including both passive and active-heating methodologies, are detailed. Heat tracing methods offer the capacity to measure soil moisture on a scale from {\~{}}??1??cm up to several km using temperature, a parameter whose measurement in VZ studies is often required anyway due to its effect on many subsurface processes. Furthermore, heat-tracing methods are not affected by high salinity pore water that can limit electromagnetic soil moisture methods. We also review coupled thermo-hydro VZ modelling software and VZ thermal regime studies and identify several knowledge gaps. With the intention to serve as an introduction to VZ heat-tracing, this review consolidates recent advances and outlines potential themes for future research.},

  abstract        = {Groundwater is an important contributor to irrigation water supplies. The time lag between withdrawal and the subsequent impacts on the river corridor presents a challenge for water management. We highlight aspects of this challenge by examining trends in the groundwater levels and changes in groundwater management goals for the Namoi Catchment, which is within the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The first high-volume irrigation bore was installed in the cotton-growing districts in the Namoi Catchment in 1966. The development of high-yielding bores made accessible a vast new water supply, enabling cotton growers to buffer the droughts. Prior to the development of a groundwater resource it is difficult to accurately predict how the water at the point of withdrawal is hydraulically connected to recharge zones and nearby surface-water features. This is due to the heterogeneity of the sediments from which the water is withdrawn. It can take years or decades for the impact of groundwater withdrawal to be transmitted kilometres through the aquifer system. We present the analysis of both historical and new groundwater level and streamflow data to quantify the impacts of extensive groundwater withdrawals on the watertable, hydraulic gradients within the semi-confined aquifers, and the movement of water between rivers and aquifers. The results highlight the need to monitor the impacts of irrigated agriculture at both the regional and local scales, and the need for additional research on how to optimise the conjunctive use of both surface-water and groundwater to sustain irrigated agriculture while minimising the impact on groundwater-dependent ecosystems.},

However, analytical methods that are commonly used are limited by uncertainties in the effective thermal diffusivity of the sediments at the SW-GW interface. We present a novel 1-D analytical method. It utilizes both the amplitude ratio and phase shift of pairs of temperature time series at the SW-GW interface to estimate the Darcy velocity. This eliminates both the need to specify a value for effective thermal diffusivity and the need for iteration. The method also allows for an estimation of effective thermal diffusivity, which can indicate periods where assumptions to the analytical solution are violated. Riverbed temperature data from the Murray Darling Basin (Australia) are used to illustrate the method.},

  abstract        = {A critical hydrological process is the interaction between rivers and aquifers. However, accurately determining this interaction from one method alone is difficult. At a point, the water exchange in the riverbed can be determined using temperature variations over depth. Over the river reach, differential gauging can be used to determine averaged losses or gains. This study combines these two methods and applies them to a 34 km reach of a semiarid river in eastern Australia under highly transient conditions. It is found that high and low river flows translate into high and low riverbed Darcy fluxes, and that these are strongly losing during high flows, and only slightly losing or gaining for low flows. The spatial variability in riverbed Darcy fluxes may be explained by riverbed heterogeneity, with higher variability at greater spatial scales. Although the river-aquifer gradient is the main driver of riverbed Darcy flux at high flows, considerable uncertainty in both the flux magnitude and direction estimates were found during low flows. The reach-scale results demonstrate that high-flow events account for 64{\%} of the reach loss (or 43{\%} if overbank events are excluded) despite occurring only 11{\%} of the time. By examining the relationship between total flow volume, river stage and duration for in-channel flows, we find the loss ratio (flow loss/total flow) can be greater for smaller flows than larger flows with similar duration. Implications of the study for the modeling and management of connected water resources are also discussed.},

The underlying transport equation relies on assumptions that could be violated using field temperature records. To test the capability of thismethod a hydraulic laboratory experiment was designed. A mass of fully water-saturated homogeneous sand was exposed to 19 different uniformpressure gradients inducing steady state Darcy velocities 0 {\textless} q {\textless} 25 m d?1. An areal heating grid generated steady sinusoidal thermal forcing.Multipoint sediment temperature responses demonstrated increasing spatial variability for increasing velocities. This introduced horizontal temperature gradients. Velocities calculated from heat tracing were compared to velocities independently obtained from solute slugs. Heat- and solute-derived velocities agreed for q {\textless} 3md?1, but heat- derived velocities were consistently larger at higher velocities. Temperature amplitude- and phase-derived velocities revealed significant scatter when compared to solute velocities. This scatter reduced when amplitude- and phase-derived velocities were compared for each sensor pair. The variability in heat-derived velocities therefore represents a spatially variable flow field in the sand. However, amplitude- and phase-derived velocities deviated from a 1:1 relationship at higher velocities. This can partly be explained by longitudinal thermal dispersivity, and partly by enhanced thermal spreading due to horizontal temperature gradients originating from nonuniform flow. This is surprising given the homogeneous sand and transition zone transport conditions (Pet {\textless} 0.7). These findings have implications for the quantification of velocities from field records because field conditions are likely more heterogeneous, which would exacerbate the effects found in this study.},

  abstract        = {A review of heat and solute transport in sediments demonstrates that the use of heat as a tracer has not been experimentally evaluated under the same experimental conditions as those used for the evaluation of solute as a tracer. Furthermore, there appears to be disagreement in the earth science literature over the significance of the thermal dispersivity term. To help resolve this disagreement, detailed experimentation with typical groundwater flow velocities (Darcy range, Re {\textless} 2.5) was conducted in a specifically designed hydraulic tank containing well-sorted saturated sand. The experiment enabled, for the first time, the precise monitoring of heat and solute tracer movement from a point source in separate runs under identical solid matrix and steady state flow conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that heat transport with natural groundwater flow velocities can reach a transition zone between conduction and convection (0.5 {\textless} Pet {\textless} 2.5). The thermal dispersion behavior can be described by using a thermal dispersivity coefficient and the square of the thermal front velocity. We propose an empirical formulation for thermal dispersion with Darcy flow in natural porous media and clarify the disagreement regarding its significance. Finally, it was observed that Darcy velocities independently derived from heat and solute experimentation show a systematic discrepancy of up to 20{\%}, and that experimental thermal dispersion results contain significant scatter.},

Multi-level array design, field deployment and parameter estimation are discussed. The applicability of analytical solutions derived from the heat transport equation to the streambed environments was analysed using the recorded temperature time series. The stream was found to lose water to the aquifer, which was supported by simultaneously recorded hydraulic gradients. However, the one-dimensional (1D) analytical solutions did not adequately describe the observed streambed thermal response at two locations. The resulting artefacts in the estimated flow velocities are discussed. Itwas hypothesised that the artefacts originate from model limi- tation due to streambed heterogeneity and application of 1D solutions tomulti-dimensional and dynamic streambed flow. This consequently imposes limitations on the field applic- ability of the methods. Nevertheless, in combination with time series of surface water and streambed water levels, the use of heat as a tracer provided a powerful tool for better understanding the shallow hydrogeological system.},

  abstract        = {The dynamic distribution of thermal conditions present in saturated near-surface sediments have been widely utilised to quantify the flow of water. A rapidly increasing number of papers demonstrate that heat as a tracer is becoming an integral part of the toolbox used to investigate water flow in the environment. We summarise the existing body of research investigating natural and induced heat transport, and analyse the progression in fundamental and natural process understanding through the qualitative and quantitative use of heat as a tracer. Heat transport research in engineering applications partly overlaps with heat tracing research in the earth sciences but is more advanced in the fundamental understanding. Combining the findings from both areas can enhance our knowledge of the heat transport processes and highlight where research is needed. Heat tracing relies upon the mathematical heat transport equation which is subject to certain assumptions that are often neglected. This review reveals that, despite the research efforts to date, the capability of the Fourier-model applied to conductive-convective heat transport in water saturated natural materials has not yet been thoroughly tested. However, this is a prerequisite for accurate and meaningful heat transport modelling with the purpose of increasing our understanding of flow processes at different scales. This review reveals several knowledge gaps that impose significant limitations on practical applications of heat as a tracer of water flow. The review can be used as a guide for further research directions on the fundamental as well as the practical aspects of heat transport on various scales from the lab to the field. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {While several studies explore cave climate and thermal regimes, little is known about the controls on cave drip water temperature. Yet water temperature significantly influences biogeochemical processes associated with cave drips. To identify the processes that control the cave drip water temperature, we measured the temperatures at multiple locations along a speleothem flow path and drip sources (stalactites) concurrently with the drip rates in Cathedral Cave, Wellington, Australia. We monitored long-term drip water temperature, drip rates, surface and cave climate and in-cave evaporation rates and conducted 3 infiltration experiments with different flow, temperature and isotopic conditions. Our results show that the drip water temperature is controlled by multiple superimposed heat transport mechanisms that act upon the infiltrating water in the epikarst, the water film after it enters the cave and before it becomes a drip. The two main heat sources/sinks for drip water are the cave air and the surrounding rock. The subsurface temperature is coupled to the surface temperature by conduction through the soil and rock mass, but the cave climate is also coupled to the surface climate by venting. On a regional scale, drip temperatures are mainly driven by the annual ground surface temperature signal but damped with depth and shifted in time compared to the surface. On a local scale, the drip water temperature can differ significantly from cave air and speleothem temperature due to the latent heat exchange of evaporation and localised water film convection. The main controls are ground surface temperature, subsurface depth, air density induced ventilation, distance from entry and drip rate. We present a conceptual model that explains drip water temperature signals and provide signal driven guidance on best type and location for speleothem sampling. We anticipate that our results will significantly improve the understanding of temperature-dependent paleoclimate signals from speleothem archives.},

  abstract        = {?2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Amplitude decay and phase delay of oscillating temperature records measured at two vertical locations in near-surface sediments can be used to infer water fluxes, thermal diffusivity, and sediment scour/deposition. While methods that rely on the harmonics-based analytical heat transport solution assume a steady state water flux, many applications have reported transient fluxes but ignored the possible violation of this assumption in the method. Here we use natural heat tracing as an example to investigate the extent to which changes in the water flux, and associated temperature signal nonstationarity, can be separated from other influences. We systematically scrutinize the assumption of steady state flow in analytical heat tracing and test the capabilities of the method to detect the timing and magnitude of flux transients. A numerical model was used to synthesize the temperature response to different step and ramp changes in advective thermal velocity magnitude and direction for both a single-frequency and multifrequency temperature boundary. Time-variable temperature amplitude and phase information were extracted from the model output with different signal-processing methods. We show that a worst-case transient flux induces a temperature nonstationarity, the duration of which is less than 1 cycle for realistic sediment thermal diffusivities between 0.02 and 0.13 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/d. However, common signal-processing methods introduce erroneous temporal spreading of advective thermal velocities and significant anomalies in thermal diffusivities or sensor spacing, which is used as an analogue for streambed scour/deposition. The most time-variant spectral filter can introduce errors of up to 57{\%} in velocity and 33{\%} in thermal diffusivity values with artifacts spanning ?2 days around the occurrence of rapid changes in flux. Further, our results show that analytical heat tracing is unable to accurately resolve highly time-variant fluxes and thermal diffusivities and does not allow for the inference of scour/depositional processes due to the limitations of signal processing in disentangling flux-related signal nonstationarities from those stemming from other sources. To prevent erroneous interpretations, hydrometric data should always be acquired in combination with temperature records.},

These solutions, however, are based upon simplifying assumptions that are frequently violated in natural systems. A nonvertical flow field, inherent to most field settings, can violate the one-dimensional (1-D) flow assumption and lead to erroneous velocity estimates. In this study, we have developed a 2-D heat and mass transport finite element-based numerical model for a stream aquifer cross section experiencing flow-through. Synthetic multilevel streambed temperature time series were generated with the model using a sinusoidal temperature boundary. The temperature data was used to quantify the vertical flow velocity with a 1-D analytical solution based on the amplitude decay and phase shift of temperature with depth. Results demonstrate that erroneous vertical components of fluid velocity can be obtained by the 1-D analytical solution when the true vertical velocity approaches zero and the flow regime becomes almost horizontal. The results also illustrate that the amplitude ratio method performs quite poorly on the gaining side of the stream where the only reliable method is phase shift. On the losing side of the stream, both methods can be employed but a better estimation is obtained from the amplitude ratio method. In general, amplitude ratio and phase shift data should be used in conjunction to maximize the information of the system.},

Three components were isolated that represented unprocessed, soil-derived humic-like and fulvic-like material, processed humic/fulvic-like material and tryptophan-like fluorescence. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on the entire dataset comprising trace element concentrations and PARAFAC scores revealed two dominant components that were identified as soil and limestone bedrock. The soil component was assigned based on significant contributions from the PARAFAC scores and additionally included Ba, Cu, Ni and Mg. The bedrock component included the expected elements of Ca, Mg and Sr as well as Si. The same elemental behaviour was observed in recent stalagmite growth collected from the site. Our experiments demonstrate that existing paleoclimate interpretations of speleothem Mg and Sr, developed in regions of positive water balance, are not readily applicable to water limited environments.

  abstract        = {The Liverpool Plains in northern New South Wales contain some of the best agricultural land in Australia and are underlain by extensive smectite clay-dominated soils sourced from weathering the alkali basalts of the Liverpool Ranges. It had been thought that a relatively simple geological model explained the underlying Cenozoic sequence with salt-rich clays of the Narrabri Formation overlying sands and gravel aquifers comprising the Gunnedah Formation. Extensive groundwater modelling based upon this simple conceptualisation has been used in management plans proposed by the mining and agricultural industries. A 31.5 m core has been recovered using minimally disturbed triple- tube coring methods at Cattle Lane (Latitude -31.52 S, Longitude 150.47 E) to resolve uncertainty concerning the aquitard status of the upper layer. Recovered core has been examined and tested to determine grainsize, cation-exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and microscopic examination of granular components. These measurements complement surface and borehole geophysical techniques, hydrogeological data and hydrochemical analysis of water samples recovered from a series of specially constructed piezometers adjacent to the cored hole. The sequence overlies a Late Cretaceous channel cut into Permian bedrock at 91mdepth with sands and clays below 31.5 m considered to represent various alluvial fill events mostly occurring since the Early Pliocene. Erosion of Late Eocene alkali basalts on the Liverpool Ranges, with the formation of smectite clays, pedogenic carbonates and with the addition of quartz from both eolian sources and locally derived from adjacent Triassic sandstone hills, provides the great majority of the sediment recovered from the cores. Late Pleistocene (114 ka) to Holocene ages were determined for the core from three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements on fine sands (13, 23 and 29 m BG). Detailed examination has failed to detect any evidence of a boundary between Narrabri and Gunnedah formations revealing rather a gradual change in dominance of clays and silts over sands and gravels embedded in a clay-rich matrix. This result challenges the conceptualisation used to conduct groundwater modelling on the Liverpool Plains.},

  abstract        = {A novel semi-analytical model for the calculation of water saturation levels in the near subsurface using passive temperature measurements is derived. The amplitude and phase of dominant natural diel temperature variations are exploited, although the solution is general so that a cyclical temperature signal of any period could be used. The model is based on the first-principles advection-conduction-dispersion equation, which is fully general for porous media. It requires a single independent soil moisture estimate, but directly considers the spatially variable saturation dependency of thermal conductivity which has been avoided in previous studies. An established empirical model for the thermal conductivity of variably saturated porous media is incorporated and two solutions for saturation are derived. Using data from numerical models, a spatially sequential implementation of one of these solutions is shown to predict the vertical saturation profile to within 2{\%} for a hydraulically stable case and to within the saturation range observed over a single day for percolation rates up to 10 cm/day. The developed model and methodology can aid in the analysis of archived temperature data from the vadose zone and will serve as a powerful tool in future heat-tracing experiments in variably saturated conditions.},

  abstract        = {Oxygen isotope ratios in speleothems may be affected by external processes that are independent of climate, such as karst hydrology and kinetic fractionation. Consequently, there has been a shift towards characterising and understanding these processes through cave monitoring studies, particularly focussing on temperate zones where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. Here, we investigate oxygen isotope systematics at Wellington Caves in semi-arid, SE Australia, where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation. We use a novel D2O isotopic tracer in a series of artificial irrigations, supplemented by pre-irrigation data comprised four years of drip monitoring and three years of stable isotope analysis of both drip waters and rainfall. This study reveals that: (1) evaporative processes in the unsaturated zone dominate the isotopic composition of drip waters; (2) significant soil zone 'wetting up' is required to overcome soil moisture deficits in order to achieve infiltration, which is highly dependent on antecedent hydro-climatic conditions; (3) lateral flow, preferential flow and sorption in the soil zone are important in redistributing subsurface zone water; (4) isotopic breakthrough curves suggest clear evidence of piston-flow at some drip sites where an older front of water discharged prior to artificial irrigation water; and (5) water residence times in a shallow vadose zone ({\textless}2 m) are highly variable and can exceed six months. Oxygen isotope speleothem records from semi-arid regions are therefore more likely to contain archives of alternating paleo-aridity and paleo-recharge, rather than paleo-rainfall e.g. the amount effect or mean annual. Speleothem-forming drip waters will be dominated by evaporative enrichment, up to {\~{}}3??? in the context of this study, relative to precipitation-weighted mean annual rainfall. The oxygen isotope variability of such coeval records may further be influenced by flow path and storage in the unsaturated zone that is not only drip specific but also influenced by internal cave climatic conditions, which may vary spatially in the cave.},

We analysed cave-air samples for their CO2 and CH4 concentrations ([CO2] and [CH4]) and carbon isotopic compositions from sampling campaigns in winter (August 2014) and summer (February 2015) at numerous heights and locations throughout Gaden and Cathedral caves, in a semi-arid environment, Wellington Caves, NSW, Australia. Ventilation is the dominant control on cave-air CO2 and CH4, with the highest cave-air CO2 concentrations ([CO2]cave) occurring in summer, in association with the lowest cave-air CH4 concentrations ([CH4]cave). Analyses show that the cave-air CO2 has both atmospheric and soil sources. Soil air and cave air in both caves undergo methanogenesis and methanotrophy, but we identify cave-specific differences in cave-air CH4 and CO2. [CH4]cave in Cathedral Cave shows an inverse relationship to [CO2]cave, particularly in areas separated from the main cave passage. In contrast, Gaden Cave has near-atmospheric [CH4]cave and isotopic ratios present at all locations sampled in winter. Where no ventilation is occurring in summer, [CH4]cave in Gaden Cave decreases, but remains reasonably high compared to Cathedral Cave. Our research shows adjacent caves vary in their ability to act as a net sink for CH4, and highlights the need for further studies before global generalisations can be made about the carbon budget of karst environments.},

As a component of the multi-institution Barrier Dynamics Experiment (BARDEX II), groundwater fluxes and flow paths within a prototype-scale sandy barrier are quantified and reported at the three fundamental spatio-temporal scales (individual waves, the beach face, and total barrier), under controlled wave and water level conditions. A particular feature of the experimental programme was the inclusion of a back-barrier ???lagoon???, that via a pump system and an intermediate water reservoir enabled the forcing of contrasting hydraulic gradients across the barrier. It was observed that the groundwater level, flow paths, and fluxes within the beach face region of the sand barrier were predominantly controlled by the action of waves at the beach face, regardless of the overall seaward- or landward-directed barrier-scale hydraulic gradients. In the presence of waves, all tests undertaken to complete this study developed a seaward gradient in this zone under the influence of waves. As a further result of wave forcing at the beach face boundary, localised groundwater flow divides were observed to develop, further partitioning the circulation and flow paths of groundwater within the prototype-scale sand barrier.},

Water sampled from two drip sites activated by irrigations carried out in summer 2014 was analysed for dissolved inorganic ions and fluorescent organic matter. The analysis allowed the development of a conceptual flow path model for each drip site. DOM analysis was further complemented by liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), applied for the first time to karst drip waters, allowing the characterisation of six organic matter fractions. The differences in organic matter fractions at each drip site are interpreted as a signature of the proposed flow paths. LC-OCD was also compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the fluorescence and good correlations were observed for high molecular weight organic matter. Strong positive correlations were also observed for high molecular weight matter and Cu and Ni. This is suggestive of colloidal transport of Cu and Ni by organic matter with high molecular weight, while small molecular weight colloids were not efficient transporters. LC-OCD uniquely provides information on non-fluorescent organic matter and can be used to further quantify drip water organic matter composition.},
